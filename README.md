# salzburgthesisdown

This project is based on the [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package.

Composition and formatting can be done using lightweight [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) syntax, and **R** code and its output can be seamlessly included using [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

## Customizing thesisdown to your institution

In an ideal world, this package would support a variety of different LaTeX templates from a wide range of institutions and we'd love to get it there at some point. Until that time, realize that this was designed to only work with the Reed College LaTeX template but others have adapted it to work with their institutions.  Here are a couple that have customized it to fit their needs.  It is recommended you review how they changed the files by comparing their repositories to this one and then make tweaks to yours as needed.  Feel free to file an issue on this repo if you have questions/troubles:
